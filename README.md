# The Zurvan Theory: A Conceptual Framework

This repository is the official home for the Zurvan Theory, a conceptual framework proposing a unitary origin for spacetime, matter, and forces. Our goal is to foster an open, collaborative environment to explore and develop this idea.

## The Paper

The foundational paper introduces the core principles of the theory. It has been submitted to arXiv and will be available at the following link once announced:

**[Link to your arXiv paper will be posted here soon]**

You can also read the final PDF directly in this repository: [zurvan_v2en.pdf](zurvan_v2en.pdf)

## Project Goal

The primary long-term goal of this project is to develop a rigorous mathematical formalism for the Zurvan framework that can produce testable predictions.

## Invitation to Collaborate

This is an ambitious, early-stage project. We welcome collaboration from physicists, mathematicians, philosophers, and anyone interested in the foundational questions of science. All constructive feedback, critiques, and new ideas are highly encouraged.

**How to Contribute:**
The best way to start a discussion or propose a new idea is by opening an "Issue." Please use the **Issues** tab at the top of this repository to ask questions, share insights, or suggest new lines of inquiry.
